Hint:
------------------------------------
HACKER1: FBI is onto me that is why I am sending you a hidden message in an
audio file.
HACKER2: What? Audio file...how the hell is that safe.
H1: It is because audio has nothing to do with it.
H2: So how can I see it.
H1: Just check the spectro......
-----DISCONNECTED--------------------
This was the conversation intercepted by FBI between two hackers. FBI has
provided you with the audio file can you help then find the message?

Hint:
In the hint it says check the spectro
After much searching I found a tool:
sonic-visualiser/kali-rolling 4.0-1 amd64
viewing and analysing the contents of music audio files
Downloaded it and opened the file
